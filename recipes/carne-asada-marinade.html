    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This carne asada marinade is our family's favorite -- and I've tried many! A 24-hour soak in spicy citrus and soy marinade ensures your flank steak will be perfectly tender when it comes off the grill.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds flank steak</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refridgerator for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill to desire doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain.</li>
        <li>Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
